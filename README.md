<h3>üè° Project Overview</h3>

The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application inspired by the popular accommodation booking platform Airbnb. The goal is to develop a functional and user-friendly booking platform where users can browse available properties, view detailed listings, and make secure bookings.

The project focuses on implementing a responsive UI, building a scalable backend API, and integrating both parts into a complete web solution. It also demonstrates real-world development workflows, including version control, documentation, and team collaboration.

<h3>üéØ Project Goals</h3>

- Build a full-stack accommodation booking platform.

- Create an intuitive, visually appealing, and mobile-responsive user interface.

- Implement core functionalities such as property search, detailed view, and booking flow.

- Integrate backend APIs for data management, authentication, and booking operations.

- Practice software engineering best practices such as modular architecture, clean code, and team collaboration using Git and GitHub.

üíª Tech Stack
Frontend - HTML, CSS, JavaScript(React.js for component-based UI development)

Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration

Design Tools: Figma for UI/UX design


<h2>üé®1. UI/UX Design Planning</h2>

  <h3>üß≠ Design Goals</h3>

The primary goal of the UI/UX design is to create an intuitive and visually consistent booking experience that enhances user satisfaction and engagement. The design focuses on clarity, ease of navigation, and responsiveness across devices.

  Key Design Goals:

üéØ Importance of Identifying Design Properties in Mockup Design

Understanding and identifying the design properties in a mockup (such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layouts) is a critical step in creating a consistent and professional user interface.

Why It‚Äôs Important:

Consistency Across Components: Ensures that all pages follow the same style guidelines, creating a unified look and feel.

Improved Developer Efficiency: Developers can easily translate Figma designs into clean, accurate frontend code without confusion.

Enhanced User Experience: Consistent colors, typography, and spacing make the platform intuitive and visually appealing.

Brand Identity: Maintains recognizable branding that helps users trust and relate to the platform.

Collaboration: Designers and developers can communicate more effectively when design properties are clearly documented.

Scalability: Enables future developers or designers to extend or modify the design without breaking the visual system.
